# LICENSE - OBJ to Tetrahedron Mesh Toolchain

This toolchain consists of three parts: **self-developed code**, a **mesh repair tool based on VCGLib**, and a **third-party tetrahedral meshing component**. Each part is governed by its own license as detailed below.

## 1. Self-Developed Code (MIT License)

The following programs and their source code are original work and are licensed under the **MIT License**:
- `obj2ply.py` / `obj2ply.exe` (OBJ to PLY converter)
- `nodele2tet.cpp` / `nodele2tet.exe` (NODE/ELE to TET converter)
- `obj2tet.cpp` / `obj2tet.exe` (One‑click OBJ → TET workflow tool)

## 2. Mesh Repair Tool – `mesh_repair.exe` (GNU GPL v3)

The executable `mesh_repair.exe` is built upon **VCGLib (Visual and Computer Graphics Library)**, which is licensed under the **GNU General Public License version 3**. Consequently, the `mesh_repair` tool as a whole is also distributed under the **GPL v3**.

- **VCGLib Homepage:** [http://vcglib.net//](http://vcglib.net/)
- **VCGLib License:** GPL v3 (the library is header‑only, but any program linking to it must comply with GPL).
- **Source Code Availability:** The complete source code of `mesh_repair` (including the VCGLib headers and the repair logic) is provided in the `mesh_repair/` folder.
- **Binary:** `mesh_repair.exe` is compiled from that source and is included in the toolchain.

**GPL v3 Compliance:**
- If you distribute `mesh_repair.exe`, you must also make the corresponding source code available (it is already included in the `mesh_repair/` folder).
- Any modification to `mesh_repair` or use of its code in another project must be released under GPL v3 as well.
- The full text of the GNU General Public License version 3 can be found in `mesh_repair/COPYING` or at [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

## 3. Third-Party Component: tetgen 1.5.1 (GNU AGPL v3)

The toolchain includes **tetgen 1.5.1** (original author Hang Si), which is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License version 3**. The folder `tetgen1.5.1/` contains the complete source code of tetgen 1.5.1 and the compiled binary `tetgen.exe`.

- **Original Author:** Hang Si
- **Official Website:** [https://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/](https://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/)
- **License Text:** The full AGPL v3 license is available in `tetgen1.5.1/AGPL-3.0.txt`.
- **Source Code:** The `tetgen1.5.1/` folder contains the exact source used to build the provided `tetgen.exe`. You can rebuild it yourself using the supplied makefiles or project files.

**AGPL v3 Compliance:**
- If you modify the source code in the `tetgen1.5.1/` folder and recompile, you **must** make your modifications available under AGPL v3.
- When distributing `tetgen.exe`, you must also distribute the corresponding source code (which is already done by including the `tetgen1.5.1/` folder).
- For commercial use, especially if the tool is used to offer a network service, please carefully review the requirements of the AGPL v3.

## 4. Overall Compliance Requirements

1. **Retain all license notices.** When distributing this toolchain, you must keep this `LICENSE` file intact. Do not delete or alter the MIT, GPL, or AGPL notices.
2. **Accompany binaries with source.** For any GPL‑ or AGPL‑licensed component (`mesh_repair.exe` and `tetgen.exe`), the corresponding source code must be made available alongside the binary. This is already satisfied by including the `mesh_repair/` and `tetgen1.5.1/` folders.
3. **Derivative works.** If you modify any part covered by GPL or AGPL, your modifications must be released under the same license. The MIT‑licensed parts can be relicensed or incorporated into proprietary projects, provided the MIT copyright notice is preserved.
4. **Independent evaluation for commercial use.** Before using this toolchain in a commercial product or service, evaluate the implications of the GPL and AGPL licenses, especially regarding the requirement to disclose source code when the software is distributed or used to provide a network service.
